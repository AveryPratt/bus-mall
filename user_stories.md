As a member of the marketing research team, I want to be able to see a graph or chart of the results from each individual survey participant as well as the total results for all participants. The data should show me the image along with the number of times the image came up, and also how many times it was clicked on.

As a developer, I want to have the images organized so that they are all equally likely to appear in each of the three positions, but not have 2 of the same image, or for one image to show up in the same place twice in a row.

As a focus group participant, I want to be given clear, concise instructions on how to do the survey, and an easy simple interface to use.

As a data analyst, I want to make sure that the participant's decisions are not influenced by anything other than the control variable (the pictures). This means the participants cannot see their scores or any results until after the survey is completed.
